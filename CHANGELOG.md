# Changelog

All notable changes to Discordinator are recorded here. The version is the
single source of truth in `src/discordinator/__init__.py` (`__version__`);
`discordinator version` prints it along with the git revision so you can tell
exactly what a machine has and whether it needs updating.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25
### Added
- `relay` CLI command and `get_new_messages` MCP tool: return only messages
  new since the last check (per-channel cursor), filtering out your own machine's
  messages. The relay primitive for two-machine handoff.
- `discordinator version` command (version + config/state paths + git revision).
- `.env` auto-loading (searches the working dir and parents) for a git-ignored,
  project-local token file.
- `.mcp.json.example` template and agent setup guide.

### Fixed
- CLI crashed printing Unicode (emoji/non-latin/code) on the Windows cp1252
  console — output is now forced to UTF-8.
- Long messages: the `[label]` tag is now applied to EVERY chunk, so multi-part
  messages stay self-identifying and relay self-filtering works on them.

### Changed
- Config and relay-state writes are now atomic (temp file + replace) for safety
  when multiple sessions run concurrently.
- MCP server silences per-request httpx INFO logging.
- Version is now sourced dynamically from the package.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25
### Added
- Initial release: REST-based Discord client, `send` / `read` / `channels` /
  `whoami` / `config` CLI commands, and an MCP server exposing `send_message`,
  `read_messages`, `list_channels`, and `whoami`.
- Named channel config (project → channel id) with a default, plus per-machine
  message labels.
